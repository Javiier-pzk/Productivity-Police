## To do list
* This is a page where you can create your daily to-do-list. You can create tasks with the + at the top right corner of the tasks screen which will lead you to a page to fill in the necessary details of your task. Tasks will be created if your task passes the validation criterias in the various fields in the creation form.

* The tasks created are stored in a list view for easy viewing and are sorted by their categories. Within each category, the tasks are then again sorted by urgency, where the task to complete first will be displayed at the top.

* For each task created, there is a checkbox at the left hand side of the task where you can toggle the completion status of the task. You can also edit or delete any task they desire with the buttons on the right. There is also a description at the bottom updating in real time to let you know how long there is left to the start of that task.

## Focus timer
* The focus timer is a page that consists of two different features, one simple timer and another, a timer that is influenced by the pomodoro study technique.

* The two different features can be accessed by the two different buttons which will take you to a separate screen showing the feature you have chosen. 

* In the standard timer feature, you can set duration for the timer using the “Set duration” button, the duration will be shown on the standard timer page under the hours, minutes and seconds circles. When the “Start timer” button is clicked, the timer will begin for whatever time you decide to set. When the timer starts, you can restart the timer or pause/start the timer. The back button will bring you back to the standard timer page.

* In the pomodoro feature, a level and exp progress bar is shown, where it keeps track of the exp you gained from using the pomodoro study technique. You get 50 EXP for each study cycle, and 100 bonus exp by completing one full pomodoro cycle. At different levels, you unlock a different badge that will be displayed on the main page of the focus timer, namely at level 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 respectively. 

* You can also set custom pomodoro durations that obey the same cycle order but with different durations. However, only a pomodoro cycle with study time larger than or equal to 25 mins, short break of duration 5 minutes, long break of duration 15 minutes will be eligible for EXP gain. This is to prevent users from abusing the pomodoro cycles and gaining exp quickly. 

* To learn more about the Pomodoro cycle, you can click on the question mark icon to open a pop up to learn more about the rules about this feature as well as learn more about the Pomodoro study technique!

## Sleep
* This page consists of 2 sub features of the sleep feature, power nap and alarm setting. The alarm setting feature allows you to set daily alarms that wake you up in the morning and reminder notifications that remind yourself to stop procrastinating on sleep and sleep at a certain time you fix.

![dailyAlarm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85099754/162948235-b085ffa0-76ca-4b82-96cb-3581f7310339.gif)

* On the other hand, the nap feature allows you to set quick nap times and snooze when needed. 
* Both features work similarly, where you are given a set of recommended time/duration for alarms and power naps respectively. You can use the picker to set your own time/duration manually as well. To save such changes, you just have to click the tick button and their new daily alarm timings will be set or they can start their naps.

## Goal Setting
* This feature has 2 sub-features namely habits and long term goals.
### Habits
* The habits feature allows you to set recurring goals over intervals of your choice (daily, weekly, monthly). You can create the habit with the + button at the top right hand corner and fill in the necessary details and select the options you want in the form. Your habit will be created if the habit passes the validation criterias in the various fields in the creation form.

* Once you create the habit, you can tap the progress circle to update their progress. For habits recorded by ‘times’ tapping it would increment the time count by 1 and increment the progress circle by the appropriate percentage. For habits recorded by ‘minutes’ or ‘hours’ tapping the circle would give you an option to fully complete the habit or enter a manual log 

* The habits reset at the end of their intervals automatically and a streak counter will show how many consecutive intervals you have completed that particular habit. Streak counters break if you miss an interval.

* An hourglass icons appears to remind you to complete your habit if you have not done so and there is only < 25% of the interval duration left
